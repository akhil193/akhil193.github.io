Dimensions can be simply explained as the number of axis you can move along. We all live in a 3D world of X, Y and Z axis. But everybody knows that there is a tiny possibility of 4th dimension or higher. Lets talk about that ....


The rule of n+1 th dimension
--------------------------------------------------

Imagine a plane P which will be our 2D world and let there be 2 people A and B. A is a circle and B is a square. Since this is a 2D world, A and B can see everything on plane P but only as a line. They have no control over Z axis which can give them a perception of what they actually are i.e. square or circle.

Suppose there is a person C, which is a Cube and has an access to third dimension. We can deduce the following statements from this

FIGURE 1

* A and B will see C as another line as long as C intersects their world at Z = 0.
* A and B will stop seeing C when C moves along Z axis i.e. when Z not = 0

This can be easily explained mathematically with concept of intersection and projections. But in naive terms, it can be explained with a statement "A and B cannot see up or down hence they cannot know what is happening there". So for A and B, C is only a line and nothing else.

So now we deduce a rule from this

"When a person with access to 3rd dimension moves along 3rd dimension, the 2 dimensional person cannot perceive him"

Let us extend it to 3D - 4D model.

"When a person with access to 4th dimension moves along 4th dimension, the 3 dimensional person cannot perceive him"

So in general we can say that

"When a person with access to n+1 th dimension moves along n+1 th dimension, the n dimensional person cannot perceive him"


Now your brain wheels might be rushing and must be thinking a lot of crazy things that can be done with this.


2. You can easily see through things
